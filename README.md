# batch_retarget_keemap
Old script I made to help me batch retarget JM animations from one skeleton to another. Probably doesn't work in the latest Blender release. Uses this addon.

# test_image
Script I made to pull images out of a Halo color plate image like the elite cubemap. This will be intergrated with the toolset though it's here for standalone use as well.
